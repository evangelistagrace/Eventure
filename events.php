                            In the last 2-3 years, we witnessed big data analytics steadily knocking down inflated
                            expectations and disillusionments to ultimately begin their journey toward high-value,
                            mainstream adoption.

                            The BIGIT2019 theme - The Rise of the Data-Driven Organization - aptly describes the current
                            state of big data adoption in Malaysia. We are beginning to discover many impactful advanced
                            analytics- and AI-driven products and solutions that are catalysts to organizational
                            transformation.

                            Yes, we are referring to increased revenues, higher efficiencies and reduced costs.

                            Come join us for BIGIT2019 to learn how advanced analytics is exploited for gains in key
                            sectors. Listen to how AI will find the next oil well. Be speechless by how credit card
                            companies exploit AI to brainwash you into parting with your money. Be reassured by how AI
                            will produce more jobs than ever.</p>
